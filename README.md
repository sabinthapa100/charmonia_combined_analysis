Charmonium Suppression Analysis Framework

A Python framework to compute the nuclear modification factor, R 
pA
​
 , by combining models for Cold Nuclear Matter (CNM) and primordial state suppression, including robust error propagation and visualization tools.

Theoretical Framework

The nuclear modification factor, $R_pA$, is calculated by factorizing contributions from CNM effects (nPDFs and energy loss) and primordial suppression.
